Costs and benefits of clutch synchronization in joint-female nests

I hypothesize that the synchronization of clutches within kin-groups provides an alternative way for dominant females to increase clutch size with a shorter laying period providing greater inclusive fitness compared to the prolonged laying of a single clutch. To test this, I manipulated joint-female clutches to create ten with exaggerated asynchronous hatching to mimic prolonged laying and nine with natural hatching synchrony. I tracked hatching success, offspring growth, and offspring survival and will use ‘mock’ measures of inclusive fitness, treating asynchronous young as if they were the dominant’s offspring, for comparison between treatments. There are a couple questions I would like to address for the project if selected: (1) Do synchronous clutches have higher reproductive output (hatching success, offspring survival, etc.) than asynchronous clutches? (2) Do joint-laid synchronous clutches provide greater inclusive fitness to dominant females compared to asynchronous clutches laid solely by the dominant female? For this, subordinate-laid eggs within synchronous clutches will be de-valued by the presumed degree of relatedness (r=0.5).
