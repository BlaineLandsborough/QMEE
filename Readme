These data are measurements of Pukeko nestlings from a number of nests of two treatment types (Experimental and control). Pukeko are precocial and able to leave the nest within a day. As a result, the number of observations for nestlings are variable in frequency and time between last observation. To test the prediction that more synchronous clutches should benefit from higher inclusive fitness, I manipulated joint-female nests, through cross-fostering of eggs, to create broods with exaggerated asynchronous hatching (Experimental treatment). I also manipulated nine joint-laid nests where I cross-fostered eggs between nests while maintaining a natural degree of hatching synchrony (Control treatment). I will use these measurements to compare nestling growth between treatments. 
Question:
Do nestlings produced by synchronous nests grow faster and survival better than nestlings from asynchronous nests?

-Need to determine how many chicks were caught and measured multiple times? How many days between first and last capture?
-Then separate out chicks that were recaught 10-60 days after the original capture date and move these observations into a new dataframe.
-
-Assess whether treatment type affects offspring growth within the first 60 days after hatching using Linear mixed-effects models.


**This is only a partial dataset, as I am still compiling observations from fieldbooks for the 2018 field season. Upon plotting out my variables using pairs(), I recognize that I need to add in more observations of nestlings when older.
